A sample app that shows off the capabilities of the IBM Watson Visual Recognition service.
The service can recognize arbitrary pictures, detect faces, gender, age range, and even some well-known celebrities.
It's also customizable and trainable, and the demo shows off every aspect of the service.

I served primarily in an advisory role, but also did some of the development work aimed,
simplifying the internals and adding automated testing / continuous delivery.
