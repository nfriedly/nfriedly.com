My Senior Project at the University of Cincinnati, Bible People is a website that indexes people in the bible and generates family trees. 

Other features include automatic Wikipedia-style disambiguation pages when two or more people have the same name, and a list of verses where the person is mentioned, including hyperlinks to other people when they are mentioned.
