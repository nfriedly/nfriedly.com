The `watson-developer-cloud` module on npm is currently the most popular way of accessing Watson APIs. 
It provides idiomatic Node.js access to every single public Watson API in a single consistent and easy-to-use package.

I took on responsibility for the overall library shortly after it's initial release, and have since authored a fair portion of it 
including several of the services, automated testing, documentation, and publishing.
