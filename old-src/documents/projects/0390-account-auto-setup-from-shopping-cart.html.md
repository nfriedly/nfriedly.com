The automatic setup system I built for iBoomerang. When a customer signs up for a new tool, if they are a current customer, it adds the tool to their account, otherwise it creates them a new account.

The Cart32 shopping cart system is a closed source system, so the auto-setup system works entirely through javascript in the templates that scrapes the users information and submits it to a PHP API I built.

You can see it live, but only if you buy something.
