I oversaw a five-man team that rebuilt the shopping cart and database of a major clay products website.

The cart was built as a front-end to the Cart32 shopping cart system. It was designed from the ground up to handle their catalogue of over 10,000 products. It included a powerful meta-data based search engine, automatically generated navigation, and a full-featured administration area.

During construction we upgraded the servers from IIS 6.0 to IIS 7.0 to enable clean urls with Microsoft's URL Rewrite module 2.0.
