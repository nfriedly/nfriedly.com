Easy to use <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> for working with the Watson Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech services in web browsers.

Can synthesize voice audio from text input and transcribe speech from various sources including microphone input, download files, and user-provided files. 
Advanced usage allows for input from arbitrary audio sources.
Supports Promises, Streams, and outputting directly to a given HTML element, including live-updating.

The library is built around a series of composable Node.js-style streams, and a few helper methods for common use cases. 

Available as `watson-speech` on npm and Bower, and also as a standalone JS file. Thoroughly documented and tested, with continuous integration and delivery.
