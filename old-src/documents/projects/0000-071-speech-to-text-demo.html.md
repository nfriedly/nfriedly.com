The Speech to Text demo allows live transcription of microphone input, user-provided audio files,
and sample audio files via the Watson Text to Speech service.

I re-created the app, building on top of my [Speech JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-speech)
 and our [React Components Library](https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/react-components/).

The updated demo is cleaner, faster, mobile-friendly, better-tested, and easier to work on and extend than the earlier one.
