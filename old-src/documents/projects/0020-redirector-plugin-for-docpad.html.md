Creates the static equivalent of 301/302 redirects for static websites (0-second meta refreshes) via configuration.

One of my major goals for v5 of nfriedly.com was a completely static website. This meant that all of the dynamic portions of my website had to be moved offsite (heroku was a big help here). At the time, DocPad didn't have a plugin to redirect certain urls to offsite locations, so I built one.

Written with CorreeScript and Cake and tested with Chai and DocPad's built-in test system (standard DocPad conventions).
