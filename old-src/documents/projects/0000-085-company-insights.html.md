I worked with a small team to create a sample application that uses a number of Watson services to show how your 
company stacks up against the competition in the news and on twitter.

Backend uses a fairly simple Express server with Redis caching on all public API endpoints. 
Frontend uses AngularJS and Sass with Gulp scripts to wire everything up and speed up development.

I also setup one-click deployment to Bluemix including an automatic DevOps Pipeline setup that automatically compiles all front-end assets and then deploys on each git push.
