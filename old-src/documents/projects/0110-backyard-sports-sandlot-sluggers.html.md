I built a custom Drupal module and an Actionscript 3.0 flash loader for the Rookie Arcade section of BYS's new website. 
These worked in concert to bring together a series of minigames written in Actionscript 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, record the scores, 
and display the high scores at the end.

I worked with two different studios on this project to bring the new site and games online in an extremely tight schedule. This included learning all three versions of ActionScript in a single week.
