<img class="right" src="/img/portfolio/gem-city-js.png" alt="" />After moving to Tipp City and not finding any local JavaScript User Group, I founded Tipp JS and started hosting meetups. I later joined forces with Sparkbox in Dayton to create Gem City JS.

I've given a variety of presentations at these and other meetups, including:
* Intro to Node.js
* Unit testing with Jasmine
* Controlling physical hardware with Node.js (both RaspberryPi and Arduino)
* Building RESTful websites with Express.js
* Building interactive websites with Meteor
* Dependency management with require.js
* Better CSS with LESS
* Intro to CoffeeScript
* Building static websites with DocPad
