I worked with the design team to get the new Watson Developer Cloud design under a tight deadline. 
The new design further improved on the previous one in terms of flexibility, performance, usability, and aesthetics. 
V2 used the same DocPad static site generator as the previous version and integrated with the same underlying content sources.
