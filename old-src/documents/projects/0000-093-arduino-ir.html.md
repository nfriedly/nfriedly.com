I used an Arduino and an IR Shield to fix a major annoyance with my TV:
it would turn the sound bar *off* but wouldn't turn it back *on.*
Now the Arduino is powered up whenever the TV comes on, and it in turn signals the sound bar to turn on.

I later rebuilt it with a Digispark to reduce free up my Arduino for other projects.
