I Joined Sociable Labs in 2010 as one of the first engineers and went on to lead the front-end engineering team.
I worked on every layer of the technology stack and helped the system grow to handle billions of requests, peaking at nearly 10,000/second.

Responsibilities included:

* Leading a team of ~5 engineers building and supporting the front-end framework and apps
* Full-stack JavaScript/Java/PostgreSQL app creation and support
* Extensive analytics, A/B testing, and data analysis
* Setting up automated code linting and unit testing
* Recruiting, training, and mentoring team members
* Supporting customer deployments written in Node.js, C#, Java, Ruby, Python, etc.


 <!--  including:
  * Gallery - a fully-customized Pinterest-like app (pictured left from Claire's)
  * Targeted Referral - scans through a user's friends and suggests specific people who are likely to be interested in the product, be it a concert on TicketMaster or a blouse on Kohl's
  * Activity Stream - live feed of who's doing what, akin to Facebook's activity feed -->
