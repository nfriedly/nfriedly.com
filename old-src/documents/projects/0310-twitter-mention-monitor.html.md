A service I put together to monitor the user's @mentions and forward them to the user as a Direct Message (DM) for faster notification. Built using Ruby on Rails and Twitter's OAuth authentication.

Taken down and released as Open Source after twitter added the same functionality - https://github.com/nfriedly/Twitter-Mention-Monitor
