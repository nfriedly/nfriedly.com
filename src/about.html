<h1>About</h1>

<p>I want to be like David, a man after Gods own heart.<br />
I want to be wise. To know when to be gentle and when to be mighty.<br />
I want to be full of passion and still lead every thought captive.<br />
I want to have abundance so that I may give abundantly. I want to do good unto all men, especially unto the household of faith.<br />
I want to look at a person and see only the best.<br />
I want to love, to be loved, to be in love, to have love, and to give love.<br />
I want to marry my best friend. And<br />
I want to be a friend to anyone who is in need of one.</p>

<h2> I &hearts; God</h2>
<img class="right" src="/img/hs_dove_bible.jpg" alt="" />
<p>(And he &hearts;'s me too - it's a mutual thing.) </p>
<p>The <strike>best</strike> second best thing I ever did with my life was become a <a href="http://fellowlaborers.org">fellowlaborer</a> for the 2007-2008 year.  It's a leadership training program / mentoring experience and it had a tremendous positive impact on my life. I now have a much closer relationship with God and some practical experience that will be a springboard for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>The <b>best</b> thing I ever did with my life was marrying Erin. More about her in a minute.</p>

<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>I am {% age %} years old. I was born in Georgia, but I've pretty much grown up in Ohio.</p>
<p>I'm a husband, a dad, and a Christian.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>Besides being tight with God, I have the sweetest, most amazingly wonderful wife I could imagine, Erin. She's the greatest thing since before sliced bread - fire and the wheel were the only two that even gave her a run for her money!</p>
<p>We now have two awesome kids who bring joy and excitement into every day.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</p>
	<cite>Colossians 3:23</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to work. Most of my work is playing with computers, but I can enjoy sweeping a floor.
	I laid tile for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Even though I went to school for it, I am mostly self-taught when it comes to computers and web development.
	I can certainly thank <a href="http://iboomerang.com">iBoomerang</a> for giving me the opportunity to grow and sharpen my skills.
	They were a great employer and I would recommend them to anyone looking for online marketing.</p>
<p>Next I started doing freelance web development and worked with a slew of fantastic companies (<a href="http://popdesignworks.com">Pop Design Works</a> was my absolute favorite). 
	It started as "nFriedly Web Development", but later became <a href="https://www.inclind.digital/">â—¢ Incline Digital LLC</a>. 
	I eventually back-burnered that to take on full-time employment with one of my clients, a small startup named Rondavu which later grew into Sociable Labs before eventually closing down.</p>
<p>After that, I worked on the Watson team at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> doing all sorts of cool stuff with AI and robotics,
then at <a href="https://www.tanium.com/">Tanium</a>, helping the US government and many large companies secure and manage their computers.</p>
<p>I'm now at <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/">Fullstory</a>, helping companies make their apps and websites less broken and frusturating.</p>


<h2>Play</h2>
<p>I <em>love</em> live music. When I was younger, I went to concerts every weekend. Now it's more like 1-2 a year, but I still enjoy them.</p>
<p>I like being outdoors: hiking, camping, sports, basically anything. I'm not all that great at any sport but I still enjoy playing most of them.</p>
<p>I also enjoy biking and will prefer it over driving any time I can.</p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of board games, and also some video games - both recent and retro.</p>
<p>I think, more than anything though, I like spending time with friends.</p>

<h2>Around the internet</h2>
