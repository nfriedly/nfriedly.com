True Tile is a local (Dayton / Troy, Ohio) tile installation service. They wanted a website where they could show off their work and also have a centralized source for services and contact information.

I assisted the owner in building the website and setting up email at the domain. We designed the site to be to be fast and responsive, optimized for both humans and Search Engines, and easy to maintain. After building the initial site, I handed it off to the business owner who filled in additional content and now maintains it.

Built with Bootstrap & Bootswatch, hosted on GitHub Pages.
