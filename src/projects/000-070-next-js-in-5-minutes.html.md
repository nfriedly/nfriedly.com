This is a Lightning Talk I gave at Tanium's October 2018 Dev Week with a quick overview of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Next.js is a React powered web framework with server-side-rendering, simple file-based routing, intelligent CSS handling, and more.
It provides everything that [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) provides and more, handling all of the plumbing and allowing you to focus on the fun parts.
