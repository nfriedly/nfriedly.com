The Klofer Building, where [Incline's](http://www.incline.digital/) offices are located, 
has a couple of additional office spaces available. 
The building owners asked me to set up a new site to advertise the available spaces and 
provide a directory of of current tenants. 

The site makes extensive use of microformats to facilitate rich, automated processing.
It also provides floorplans, a map, and some of the history of the building.
