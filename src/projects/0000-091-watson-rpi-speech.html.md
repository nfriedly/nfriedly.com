My first in a series of Watson/<abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> demos, this one employs a Raspberry Pi that 
announces the current time and weather over the system speakers at the press of a button. Uses Node.js and the newer 
Linux userspace GPIO support to avoid needing to run as root.

This design focused on energy and bandwidth efficiency: it uses interrupts rather than polling the GPIOs, it uses 
omxplayer to ensure the audio is decoded in hardware, and it caches the audio files to disk for potential reuse later.
