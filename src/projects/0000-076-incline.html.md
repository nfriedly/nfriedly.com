After more than a dozen years as nFriedly Web Development, I decided to rebrand my business as Incline. 
The new name better represent the growing size, scope, and goals of the business.

The design features a [stunning mountain photo](https://unsplash.com/@samferrara?photo=IEHPDNk2-8w)

It's built with Jekyl and Bootstrap v4-alpha. 
At the time of writing, it's not fully complete, but it is live and functional.
It's currently using several emojii, 
although they will likely be replaced by Font Awesome once v5 ships.
