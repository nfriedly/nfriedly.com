My team and I started developing a collection of reusable React components that build on top of the
[Watson UI Components](https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/ui-components/)
 library to support rapidly building demos and other web apps.

The components are general UI widgets that do not directly interact with Watson services, but the library includes things
such as an image picker that would be helpful when building Watson-powered applications.

My contributions included creating and enhancing several of the components, automating deployment, improving testing,
and improving the documentation and examples.
