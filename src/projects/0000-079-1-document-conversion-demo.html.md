The Watson Document Conversion service accepts documents in a variety of formats and converts them to formats
compatible with the Watson Retrieve and Rank service.

I helped to create both the initial version of the Document Conversion demo, and the updated one based on our
[React components Library](https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/react-components/).
