I simplified the app, switching from Ruby on Rails to single-page app and from a complete breakdown of every detail to a no-nonsense identification of the browser and OS. 
I also updated the design to use the Bootstrap CSS framework.

So far, the new site has achieved 2x and then 2.5x year-over-year growth, reaching the top position in Google for "whats my user agent", and third place for "user agent".

In early 2017, I sold the original url (whatsmyua.com) and moved the site to it's current url: [user-agent.io](http://www.user-agent.io/)
