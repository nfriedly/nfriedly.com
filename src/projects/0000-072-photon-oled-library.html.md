Library to connect an [Adafruit SSD1351 1.5" Color OLED](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1431) breakout board to a
[Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit).

I built on top of the working driver created by Adafruit and the Particle community, filling in the gaps and adding polish.

My contributions included adding wiring instructions, adding and tweaking the example,
packaging it in the Particle library format, and generally improving the documentation.
