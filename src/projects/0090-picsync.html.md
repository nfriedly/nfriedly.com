<img class="right" src="/img/portfolio/picsync-phone-shadow.png" alt="" />PicSync automatically uploads photos you take on your Android phone to a private album. It will then remind you about the photos the next time you log into Facebook allowing you to review and post your favorites.

PicSync is no longer under active development as it failed to find much traction. The source code is available on Github: [client](https://github.com/nfriedly/picsync-android-client), [server](https://github.com/nfriedly/picsync-server)
