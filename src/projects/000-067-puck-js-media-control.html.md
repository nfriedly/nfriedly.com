This is a [Puck.js](https://www.puck-js.com/) device running the [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) JavaScript environment and a script that I wrote to control media playback.

I listen to a lot of AudioBooks, and my earbuds have touch controls that just don't seem to work very well. So, I created this to give me a physical button that works every time and also provides better feedback.

* A short press toggles play/pause and blinks green once.
* A long press triggers 3 previous track commands and blinks blue once.
