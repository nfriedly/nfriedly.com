I built the previous version of my website with a PHP/CodeIgniter core and a custom theme designed by [Charley Skira].

The site served to introduce and support myself and my freelance business. Features included:
* Accounts management system where clients could view past and current invoices and pay any balance due via a fully secured and PCI-compliant credit card processing system.
* WordPress-based [technical blog] with a custom theme and a small plugin that I built  to seamlessly unite it with the rest of the site.
* Portfolio and several SEO-optimized pages highlighting the various services I offered.
* YUI-based "Instant Estimate" form that gave a hassle-free way of estimating a project's cost.
* [Spam-proof contact form]
* Technical demos of working with various APIs from Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc.
