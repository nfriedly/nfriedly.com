<img class="right" alt="" src="/img/portfolio/dmavs.png" /> I built a tool for updating Facebook and Twitter pages that also helped find and respond to posts from fans. It has been used by several businesses and sports teams.

The tool is entirely JavaScript based, and can thus be easily embedded into various websites regardless of the backend technology.
