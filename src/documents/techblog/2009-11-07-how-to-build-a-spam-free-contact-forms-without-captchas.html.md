They use impossible-to-read captcha images, or they make users jump through some kind of hoop to get the email address instead of just clicking on it. **This can mean lost sales and opportunities for you, because each hurdle turns away more users. **

This article looks at how to use some simple HTML, CSS, & Javascript to protect your private information without making your guests jump through hoops.

## The Goal

I want users to be able to contact me simple and easy, no captchas, no math problems, just a regular contact form, clickable email address, and everything copy-paste-able.

## The Problem

Spammers love captcha-free forms and clickable email addresses. I do not want to receive a ton of spam!

## The Solution

With a little bit of CSS and JavaScript wizardry, we can make a simple, easy-to-use contact page that will block almost all automated contact form spam.

### Part 1: The Contact Form

We are going to make a standard contact form with one extra feature: an input named &#8220;url&#8221; and a note beside it that says &#8220;Don&#8217;t type anything here!&#8221;

The HTML:

``` html

<form action="/submit.php" method="post">

	<p>Your name: <input type="text" name="name" /></p>

	<p>Your email: <input type="text" name="email" /></p>

	<p class="antispam">Leave this empty: <input type="text" name="url" /></p>

	<p><textarea name="message"></textarea></p>

	<p><input type="submit" value="Send" /></p>

</form>
```

Then we use CSS to hide the input and the note.

The CSS:

``` css
.antispam { display:none;}
```

Then we make a rule in the server that says &#8216;if the user typed anything in the &#8220;url&#8221; box, then throw it out.&#8217;

The PHP:

``` php
<?php 
// if the url field is empty 
if(isset($_POST['url']) && $_POST['url'] == ''){
 	// then send the form to your email
 	 	mail( 'you@yoursite.com', 'Contact Form', print_r($_POST,true) ); 
} 
// otherwise, let the spammer think that they got their message through
?>

<h1>Thanks</h1>

We'll get back to you as soon as possible
```

A regular person won&#8217;t even see the box normally, and will therefore leave it blank without even thinking about it. If the CSS fails to load, they get a note explaining what to do.

However, when a spam bot looks at this, it sees a good spot to stick whatever spammy url they&#8217;re trying to advertise.

Now the php script on the server can tell who is a spammer and who isn&#8217;t. The regular people get sent to your email, the spammers get ignored!

### Part 2:  Click-able Email Address

Spammers steal your email address by scanning through the source code of the site and grabbing anything that looks like an email address. So we&#8217;re going to make sure that there is no email address in the source code and instead generate it by JavaScript.

The Javascript:

``` js
var first = "yourname";

var last = "yoursite.com";
```

The HTML:

``` html
My e-mail address:

<script type="text/javascript">
document.write('<a href="mailto:'+first + '@' + last+'">'+first + '@' + last+'<\/a>');
</script>

<noscript>
Please enable javascript or use my <a href="/contact.php">contact form</a>
</noscript>
```

A regular user will see a regular email address and things just work. A user who happens to have javascript disabled will see an explanation and an alternative solution. And a spammer won&#8217;t see a thing!

This method can easily be extended to phone numbers and other personal information.

## Advanced version: Prettier message body and a proper `From:` field

These were the most commonly requested features, so I added an advanced version that changes the `From:` field of the email to whatever the user typed in the box, and removes all of the `Array` brackets from the body of the message:

``` php
<?php 
// if the url field is empty 
if(isset($_POST['url']) && $_POST['url'] == ''){

 	// put your email address here 	
 	$youremail = 'you@yoursite.com';
 	
 	// prepare a "pretty" version of the message
 	$body = "This is the form that was just submitted: 	
Name:  $_POST[name]
E-Mail: $_POST[email]
Message: $_POST[message]"; 
 		
 	// Use the submitters email if they supplied one 	
 	// (and it isn't trying to hack your form). 	
 	// Otherwise send from your email address. 	
 	
 	if( $_POST['email'] && !preg_match( "/[\r\n]/", $_POST['email']) ) {
 		$headers = "From: $_POST[email]"; 	
 	} else {
 		$headers = "From: $youremail"; 
 	}
 	
 	// finally, send the message 	
 	mail($youremail, 'Contact Form', $body, $headers ); } // otherwise, let the spammer think that they got their message through ?>
```

The `preg_match()` is there to make sure spammers can&#8217;t abuse your server by injecting extra fields (such as CC and BCC) into the header. Take a look at <http://www.thesitewizard.com/php/protect-script-from-email-injection.shtml> for more info.

## Advanced version 2: Don't send blank emails

``` php
<?php

// if the url field is empty
if(isset($_POST['url']) && $_POST['url'] == ''){

    if($_POST["message"] == "" || $_POST["name"] == ""){
        echo "<p>Please press the back button and fill in all fields</p>";
    } else {
        // then send the form to your email
        mail( 'you@yoursite.com', 'Contact Form', print_r($_POST,true) );
    }
}

// otherwise, let the spammer think that they got their message through

?>

<h1>Thanks</h1>
<p>We'll get back to you as soon as possible</p>
```

## Advanced version 3: Redirect to a new page

``` php
<?php

// if the url field is empty 
if(isset($_POST['url']) && $_POST['url'] == ''){
 	// then send the form to your email
 	 	mail( 'you@yoursite.com', 'Contact Form', print_r($_POST,true) ); 
} 
// otherwise, let the spammer think that they got their message through

header('Location: http://www.mysite.com/thankyou.html');
exit('Redirecting you to http://www.mysite.com/thankyou.html');

?>
```

### WordPress version

I found that there is an anti-spam plugin for WordPress that uses similar methods to the ones I describe here: <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nospamnx/> &#8211; I installed it on this blog and it&#8217;s stopped nearly 30,000 spam comments so far.

## Need help?

I can help you get set up and/or connect you to other competent developers. 
A typical installation would be around $500 for me to perform it, but you can likely find a lower-cost option by posting a job on [elance](https://www.elance.com/?rid=1IFCM). 
(Link to this page in the job description and then search for developers with `php` and `email` skills and invite them to submit a bid.)
