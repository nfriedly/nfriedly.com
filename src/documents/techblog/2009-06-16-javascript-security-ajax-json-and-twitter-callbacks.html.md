But to get the most benefit out of it, you really need to understand what it&#8217;s doing.

We&#8217;re going to look at how AJAX security works, specifically the Same Origin Policy, how Twitter gets around it, and the type of callback that twitter uses.

Note: the callback that twitter uses is entirely different from callback in the sense of passing a javascript function around as a variable. We&#8217;ll look at that in a future article.

## AJAX Security

The XMLHTTPRequest Object, which is the javascript object used to make AJAX requests, has a &#8220;[Same Origin Policy][1]&#8221; which basically means that javascript on site1.com cannot use AJAX to directly load data from site2.com. This is a security feature, as it makes XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks more difficult.

Worth noting, if the website is at site1.com, no scripts can communicate with any other site, even if the script was loaded from site2.com.

## Work Arounds

There are a number of workarounds including iframes, java applets, and flash, but here&#8217;s a couple of the more common methods.

### <img src="http://www.sxc.hu/pic/m/c/cw/cwmgary/486891_all_lined_up.jpg" alt="Line em up!" class="alignright" />Proxying Requests

The way proxying works is to have a file on your server that grabs the data from a remote server and passes it along. Then for javascript, the data appears to be coming from your server, even though it actually originated at a remote server. This is what the Fancy part of my [twitter demo][2] does.

We&#8217;ll look at using a proxy to get remote data in a future article.

### Remotely hosted javascript files

Scripts stored on other websites can be included on a page. As long as the script doesn&#8217;t need to call home after the initial load, everything works great. This is how a basic twitter function works: you load a script from twitter&#8217;s website and it communicates with your site via the callback feature. This is what the Simple part of my [twitter demo][2] does.

Here is a very basic page that uses Twitter&#8217;s callback feature and a remotely loaded javascript file to show my twitter status &#8211; remote data &#8211; on my website, by interacting with local javascript.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"  dir="ltr" lang="en-US">
<head>
<title>Simple Twitter Status</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My Twitter Status:</h1>

<div id="twitter_status">Loading...</div>

<!-- Put scripts down here for speed -->


<!-- this must come before we load the twitter script -->
<script type="text/javascript">

function showStatus(json){
	json = json[0]; // we only care about the most recent status;
	var myDiv = document.getElementById('twitter_status');
	myDiv.innerHTML = '<img src="'
		+ json.user.profile_image_url
		+ '" style="float:left; margin:5px 10px 10px 0">'
		+ json.text;
}

</script>



<!-- now load the twitter file -->

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/nfriedly.json?count=1&amp;callback=showStatus&amp;random=<?php echo time(); ?>" /></script>

</body>
</html>
```

## Digging into Twitter&#8217;s callback method

Below is a trimmed down example of what Twitter&#8217;s API sends back when we make the request in the example above.

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">showStatus([{"in_reply_to_screen_name":null,"text":" [ Lots of information that I'm omitting because it's not the point. ] "]);

</pre>

Now, don&#8217;t worry about the jazz in the middle, just look at that showStatus(); that&#8217;s wrapped around it. First of all, how does Twitter even know that we have a function named show status? Because we said so in the url to the file -see how we added `&callback=showStatus`? That&#8217;s where the magic is.  (Ok, technically we said `&amp;` not just `&`, but that was just to pass XHTML validation. )

### Cross-domain!

There&#8217;s a second important thing going on here &#8211; javascript from two different domains are interacting with each other. This is allowed because of how the Same Origin Policy works &#8211; everything is restricted to the local domain, but that means that everything can work together on the same plane.

### It&#8217;s a beautiful thing

I hope this gave you a little bit better understanding of how AJAX security works and how Twitter gets around it and is still able to interact with your site. In the future, I&#8217;ll have an article on how &#8220;traditional&#8221; callbacks work that will use jQuery and more AJAX to dive a bit deeper into the topic.
