The [GPD Win 2](https://gpd.hk/gdpwin2) is a small computer designed for gaming on-the-go. It has an upgradeable 128GB M.2 2242 SATA SSD. I revent;y upgraded it to a 1TB drive from KingSpec.

I bought a [1 TB KingSpec SSD](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Kingspec-120GB-HDD-22-42mm-NGFF-M2-SATA-SSD-Solid-State-Hard-Disk-Harddisk-Drive-for/32465074880.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.7b364c4duOdIk5) for my Win 2 on Ali Express. The default free shipping option took 20 days to arrive. I also ordered an [M.2 USB enclosure](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2015-New-products-Design-micro-hdd-box-usb-3-0-to-mSATA-2-5-suit-for/32506466451.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.7b364c4duOdIk5) for the old drive which arrived the day after.

Installation was easy-peasy: unscrew the SSD cover, pop out the old drive, pop in the new drive, screw the cover bax
k on.

I opted to go with a fresh install of Windows 10. You can download [Microsoft's Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) to make a bootable USB drive with the Windows 10 installer.

I rebooted with the windows 10 USB stick inserted, so it initially booted from that and then had things correctly configured to boot from the SSD afterwards.

After the installation, Windows spent about 45 minutes downloading and installing updates.

Everything but the touchscreen worked automatically. I grabbed the [touchscreen driver](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/8ichgg/gpd_win_2_touch_driver_march_2018_with_download/) that [u/mefaun](https://www.reddit.com/user/mefaun) posted and installed it without any trouble.

I installed Steam and a couple of games, and everything just worked.

I did hit the "boot shell bug" once later after swapping the old drive in and out, but it was easy to correct in the BIOS.

Here's a couple of benchmarks of the new and old drives:

Note that this wasn't a perfect apples-to-apples comparison, because the old drive was 85% full and SSD write speeds may decrease as the drive approaches 100% full. However, that's probably fairly representative of real-world usage (if not slightly less full than normal - I actually deleted 2 games to bring it down to 85%).

In short, I'm very happy with the upgrade.
