<img class="right" src="/img/blog/v90/0-v90.jpg" alt="Powkiddy V90" /> I recently acquired a [Powkiddy V90](https://powkiddy.com/products/powkiddy-v90-3-inch-ips-screen-flip-handheld-console-dual-open-system-game-console-16-simulators-retro-ps1-kids-gift-3d-new-game), which is a Linux-powered handheld retro gaming device.  It's reminiscent of a Game Boy Advance SP,  and it is capable of playing most GBA games in addition to many other consoles including NES, SNES, Genesis, and even some PS1 games! <!--more--> It retails for $30-40 and comes ready-to-play, although you'll probably also want to buy a name-brand microSD card and install the [Miyoo custom firmware](https://github.com/TriForceX/MiyooCFW) on it.

I really love this device, but, it's cheap. Like, *really* cheap. The CPU is the same one that's in the <$3 [business card that runs Linux](https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/).  Furthermore, through ignorance, apathy, or cost-savings (probably some of all three), they only connected the power and ground pins on the USB port. This is good enough when charging via a USB-A ports, because they always provide power. But, when charging from a USB-C port, this doesn't work because when connecting from one USB-C port to another, they first have to decide *which* side supplies the power.

I was vaguely aware that this could be done with resistors after reading about the Raspberry Pi 4 fiasco. (Short version: the spec calls for two resistors, the Pi 4 used one, it worked sometimes but not always.) [Benson Leung has a good article](https://medium.com/@leung.benson/how-to-design-a-proper-usb-c-power-sink-hint-not-the-way-raspberry-pi-4-did-it-f470d7a5910) that explained that situation and gave me a good head start on what I needed to do here. That led me to reading (part of) the actual [USB-C specification](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/USB%20Type-C%20Spec%20R2.0%20-%20August%202019_0.pdf), specifically Section 4.5.1.3.2 Sink Configuration Channel Functional Model and Table 4-25 Sink CC Termination (Rd) Requirements.

For a device that is only a sink (meaning it only takes power and never supplies power), and only needs 5 volts and no more than 3 amps (15 watts), the setup is fairly simple. The CC1 and CC2 pins each need to be connected to ground (pulled down) via 5.1 kΩ resistors. I happened to have some of these resistors that I got in a [kit from electrodragon](https://www.electrodragon.com/product/14w-resistor-kit-accuracy-in-1-2020pcs/) (600 resistors for $3, or $0.005 per resistor.)

Now I just needed to figure out which pins were CC1 and CC2. For that, I bought a [couple of USB-C test/pass-through/break out boards off of Ali Express](https://m.aliexpress.com/item/1005001300974530.html) off of Ali Express. On this particular adapter, the pins are mostly labeled by pin number rather than function, so CC1 is A5 and CC2 is B5. I figured it out the hard way, but it turns out it's also listed in the spec, in Table 3-4 USB Type-C Receptacle Interface Pin Assignments under Section 3.2.3 Pin Assignments and Descriptions 🤷‍♂️

I used the first one with a multi-meter to determine which pins on the V90 matched to CC1 and CC2, and I soldered resistors onto the second one to test my theory that all the V90 needed was a couple of resistors. The test results confirmed it - with the resistors soldered into the breakout board, I could charge from my 87W USB-C MacBook Pro charger. (Obviously not at 87 watts, [the v90 only draws a maximum of ~3.5W when gaming *and* charging](https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/pejfl3/v90_power_draw_information/) - but the point is that it worked after I added the two resistors, and other chargers should also work.

In my case, the correct pins for CC1 and CC2 on the V90 were the leftmost and second-to-the-right "small" pins (the bigger pins on the ourside edges are VCC and ground), but I won't guarentee that they are in the same order on your device. 

Next came the fun part: actually soldering in the resistors. The connectors are *tiny* and my soldering skills are somewhat 💩.  

Getting the resistors to stay put while I soldered them was a huge pain. I bent them, clipped them short, then used a helping hand to hold them, and another one to hold a magnefying lense. In hindsight, maybe I should have kept them straight and taped them in place. Oh well.

![Getting ready to solder the first resistor](/img/blog/v90/2-soldering.jpg)

I confirmed that the outer layer of the USB-C plug was connected to ground, so I just soldered both of my resistors to that, rather than try to handle a second round of tiny pin soldering.

![Soldered!](/img/blog/v90/3-soldered.jpg)

In the end, I accidentally shorted SBU1 to CC1 and SBU2 to CC2, but it didn't seem to cause any problems, so I left it.  (I also accidentally shorted VCC to ground, but I fixed that one.)

![Initial test](/img/blog/v90/4-test.jpg)

I haven't yet, but I'll probalby put a blob of hotmelt glue over the resistors to keep them from getting shook out of place. 

Quick testing with my macbook charger confirmed that I had done the job correctly, or, at least, correctly enough :D

In summary, I'm happy that my V90 now works with any USB-C charger, but I really wish Powkiddy had just done this at the factory. I would have gladly paid the extra $0.01.
