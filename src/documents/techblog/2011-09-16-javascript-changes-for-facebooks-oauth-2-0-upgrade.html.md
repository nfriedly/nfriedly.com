<img class="alignright" src="http://oauth.net/images/oauth-2-sm.png" alt="" width="124" height="123" style="margin-bottom: 0;" />I just finished a writeup on the necessary JS changes to support Facebook's OAuth 2.0 upgrade, and then Hilary did a followup post on the server-side.

Part 1: JavaScript -Â [JavaScript changes for Facebook's OAuth 2.0 upgrade][1]

Part 2: PHP / Backend - [Server Side changes for Facebook's OAuth 2.0 upgrade][2]

Also worth noting, there's a lot of good information on [Facebook's Developer Blog][3].
