I presented on using Watson and <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> together at Tech Crunch's Disrupt SF 2015. 
I put together a demo to accompany the presentation that allowed you to use voice control to turn light on and off over the internet.
It combined an ESP8266 connected to the IoT Foundation cloud service (MQTT broker), 
a web app employing the Watson Speech to Text service, and a Node Red instance connecting all the dots. 

The presentation itself had voice-controlled slides and gave an overview of the various pieces of the demo, how they fit together, and how to build on them to create new applications.
