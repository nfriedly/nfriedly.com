I built a custom Drupal module and an Actionscript 3.0 flash loader for the Rookie Arcade section of BYS's new website. These worked in concert to bring together a series of minigames written in Actionscript 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, record the scores, and display the high scores at the end.<img src="/img/portfolio/bys-football.png" alt="" class="right" style="margin-top: 6px; margin-left: 2px;" />

I worked with two different studios on this project to bring the new site and games online in an extremely tight schedule. This included learning all three versions of ActionScript in a single week.
