I've been playing with the ESP8266EX modules that include WiFi, CPU, RAM, and Flash all in one. 
The ESP-01 variant is by far the cheapest and easiest to find, but it's pin layout is awkward to say the least.
I built this motherboard to make it easy to power and program from a standard FTDI USB/Serial-TTL programmer and then put 
together a writeup to make it easy for others to follow.
