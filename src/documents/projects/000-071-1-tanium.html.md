Tanium offers a platform and suite of modules for large enterprises and government agencies to manage and secure their entire fleet of computers.

My team and I launched the Threat Response module which has a number of capabilities to support both automatic handling of computer threats as well as supporting manual investigation and remediation.

Threat Response keeps a database of activity on each endpoint such as registry changes, driver loads, and filesystem modifidation. It can match these changes against known and suspected threats in realtime and effiently scan an the history of every computer on the network once a suspicious pattern has been identified to ensure any threat is fully isolated.

My personal contributions covered a variety of tasks including:

* Performance optimizations to enable near-realtime search of upwards of a million computers
* Mentoring and training of the team, covering Node.js and security vulnerabilities in particular
* Automated E2E testing that included spinning up and managing entire virtualized networks of computers
* Enhancing the WebSocket "Live Endooint Connection" to support remote filesystem manipluation
* Developing cross-polatform python scripts that run on millions of endpoints silmutaneously
* UI & UX improvements with AngularJS and later React
* Automated linting and unit tests with ESLint, Pylint, Jasmine, tox
* SQL Server, Postgres, and SQLite database administration
