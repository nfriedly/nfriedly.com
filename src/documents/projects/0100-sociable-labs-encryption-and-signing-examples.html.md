We accept signed and/or encrypted data from our customers and we provide example code in a variety of languages. 
I Wrote example code in C# and Node.js, and also published a <a href="https://github.com/nfriedly/SLSignPageData">SLSignPageData</a> library to NPM to enable easy data signing in node.js projects.
