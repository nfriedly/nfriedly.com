	$ ant compile
	Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
	Build failed

On my system, there&#8217;s only one main project that uses ant, so I almost always intend for ant tasks to be run against that project&#8217;s build.xml. So, I created a function that makes ant tasks &#8220;just work&#8221; no matter what directory I am in.

### The code

First you&#8217;ll need to edit your `.profile` file. To do so, run the following command:

`nano ~/.profile`

Then copy-paste in this code, changing the `DEFAULT_ANT_DIR` to the path to your project (whatever folder has the build.xml file in it):

``` bash
# make ant commands run in the default directory if
# there is no build.xml in the current directory

export DEFAULT_ANT_DIR = /path/to/your/projects/folder/

function magic-ant() {
  if [ -e ./build.xml ]
	then
	  ant $@                                                                    
	else
	  pushd DEFAULT_ANT_DIR
	  ant $@
	  popd
  fi
}

# reset ant to avoid loops if you ever run `source ~/.profile` again
alias ant=`which ant`
alias ant="magic-ant"
```

Press `[Control]-O` then `[Enter]` to save and `[Control]-X` to exit nano.

Lastly, run this command to import your changes (or just close and reopen your terminal):

`source ~/.profile`

### How it works

First, we define the path in a shell variable with the path to the default ant project. This isn&#8217;t absolutely required, but it keeps things tidy and simple.

<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/95/235488979_24ead7f4dc_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="Ant" class="left" />Next, we create the `magic-ant` function which checks if there is a build.xml file in the current directory. If so, it uses that one, otherwise it calls `pushd` to temporarily change directories to our default one, runs the ant command, and then calls `popd` to get back to whatever directory you started in. `$@` is an automatic variable that includes whatever parameters this function was called with.

After that we use alias to reset the ant command in order to avoid endless loops where our magic-ant function calls itself instead of the real ant if you source. The command `which` returns the path to the program with the given name. Putting it in backticks (\`) makes bash execute the command and return the result.

Finally we alias `ant` to point to our new `magic-ant` function when run from the command line.

The only downside is that I haven&#8217;t yet figured out how to make [Ant task tab completion][4] work with this when you&#8217;re not in the project directory.
