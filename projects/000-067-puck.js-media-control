<p>This is a <a href="https://www.puck-js.com/">Puck.js</a> device running the <a href="https://www.espruino.com/">Espruino</a> JavaScript environment and a script that I wrote to control media playback.</p>
<p>I listen to a lot of AudioBooks, and my earbuds have touch controls that just don&#39;t seem to work very well. So, I created this to give me a physical button that works every time and also provides better feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>A short press toggles play/pause and blinks green once.</li>
<li>A long press triggers 3 previous track commands and blinks blue once. (I have my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer">audiobook player</a> configured to interpret &quot;previous track&quot; as a 10-second rewind.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It will blink red 3 times if it&#39;s disconnected or green 3 times if it&#39;s connected.</p>
