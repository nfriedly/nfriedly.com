<p>A device that answers the question of &quot;Did anyone feed the dog yet?&quot;</p>
<p>Built with an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4600">Adafruit QT Py</a> running <a href="https://circuitpython.org/">CircuitPython</a>, a door sensor, and a dog food container, it detects when the door to the dog food container is opened/closed and colors the LED to indicate when the dog was fed last:</p>
<p>ðŸŸ¢ Green indicates that the dog has been fed her breakfast / dinner (or at least that the food container has been opened within the last 8 hours)
<br>
ðŸ”´ Red indicates the dog has not been fed her current meal
<br>
ðŸ”µ Blue indicates the door is opened now, or the wire is disconnected, or the microcontroller rebooted and doesn&#39;t know the last time the door was opened. After the door has been opened for a brief period, it switches to rainbow to indicate that the timer has been reset.</p>
