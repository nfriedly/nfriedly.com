<p>I needed a simple <code>zip</code> command that worked both on Windows and Mac. 
Windows has no native <code>zip</code> command, so <code>bestzip</code> uses a Node.js implimentation there.
However, Mac OS X includes a native <code>zip</code> command that is both faster than the Node.js implementations and produces smaller files, 
so <code>bestzip</code> will use that one whenever possible.</p>
