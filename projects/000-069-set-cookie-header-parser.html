<p>Library to allow Node.js (and other non-browser JS environments such as React Native) to parse Set-Cookie headers sent by other servers. </p>
<p>Most Set-Cookie headers are straightforward to parse, but the HTTP spec allows for headers to be combined into a single comma-separated string, which adds some significant complexity to parsing. </p>
<p>set-cookie-parser is well-tested and widely deployed both in apps and as a dependency in other over 100 other libraries with over 1 million monthly downloads.</p>
<p>This library was initially part of <a href="https://github.com/nfriedly/node-unblocker">unblocker</a>, but was spun off due to it&#39;s complexity and gnereral usefullness.</p>
