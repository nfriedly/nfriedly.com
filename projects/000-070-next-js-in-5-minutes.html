<p>This is a Lightning Talk I gave at Tanium&#39;s October 2018 Dev Week with a quick overview of <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>.</p>
<p>Next.js is a React powered web framework with server-side-rendering, simple file-based routing, intelligent CSS handling, and more.
It provides everything that <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> provides and more, handling all of the plumbing and allowing you to focus on the fun parts.</p>
