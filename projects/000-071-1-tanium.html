<p>Tanium offers a platform and suite of modules for large enterprises and government agencies to manage and secure their entire fleet of computers.</p>
<p>My team and I launched the Threat Response module which has a number of capabilities to support both automatic handling of computer threats as well as supporting manual investigation and remediation.</p>
<p>Threat Response keeps a database of activity on each endpoint such as registry changes, driver loads, and file system modification. It can match these changes against known and suspected threats in real time and efficiently scan the history of every computer on the network once a suspicious pattern has been identified to ensure any threat is fully isolated.</p>
<p>My personal contributions covered a variety of tasks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance optimizations to enable near-real time search of upwards of a million computers</li>
<li>Mentoring and training of the team, covering Node.js and security vulnerabilities in particular</li>
<li>Automated E2E testing that included spinning up and managing entire virtualized networks of computers</li>
<li>Enhancing the WebSocket &quot;Live Endpoint Connection&quot; to support remote file system manipulation</li>
<li>Developing cross-platform python scripts that run on millions of endpoints simultaneously</li>
<li>UI &amp; UX improvements with AngularJS and later React</li>
<li>Automated linting and unit tests with ESLint, Pylint, Jasmine, tox</li>
<li>SQL Server, Postgres, and SQLite database administration</li>
</ul>
